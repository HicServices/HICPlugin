### HIC Package Source

To build this private repository you will need to add the HIC 'Package source':

Unfortunately since this is a private repository you must build and release the package by hand and the CI tests will never pass.
Bad times I know but such is the nature of private repositories.

The main README.md describes how to perform a manual build of the .nupkg file
